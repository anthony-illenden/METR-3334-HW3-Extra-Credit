# METR-3334-HW3-Extra-Credit
This project is related to a homework assignment in METR 3334: Principles of Research and Communications in Meteorology. The assignment required us to reproduce a figure in a published journal article relevant to our research topic. I chose to reproduce a figure from an article that discussed forecasting lake effect snow in great detail [Winter Weather Forecasting Throughout the Eastern United States. Part IV: Lake Effect Snow](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010%3C0061:WWFTTE%3E2.0.CO;2). Figure 1 is a time series graph of the air and lake temperatures at Buffalo, New York throughout the year.
