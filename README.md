# METR-3334-HW3-Extra-Credit
This project is related to a homework assignment in METR 3334: Principles of Research and Communications in Meteorology. The assignment required us to reproduce a figure in a published journal article relevant to our research topic. I chose to reproduce a figure (see below) from an article that discussed forecasting lake effect snow in great detail, [Winter Weather Forecasting Throughout the Eastern United States. Part IV: Lake Effect Snow](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010%3C0061:WWFTTE%3E2.0.CO;2). Figure 1 is a time series graph of the air and lake temperatures throughout the year at Buffalo, New York. There may be a few differences between the figure in the journal article and mine, but they are practically the same. For example, the temperatures are different because the data sets I used included an additional 20+ years worth of data. The [air](https://www.weather.gov/buf/BUFtemp) and [water](https://www.weather.gov/buf/Hist_LakeTemps) temperature data sets are both from the National Weather Service of Buffalo.
