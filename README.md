# METR-3334-HW3-Extra-Credit
## Description
This project is related to a homework assignment in METR 3334: Principles of Research and Communications in Meteorology. The assignment required us to reproduce a figure in a published journal article relevant to our research topic. I chose to reproduce a figure (see below) from an article that discussed forecasting lake effect snow, [Winter Weather Forecasting Throughout the Eastern United States. Part IV: Lake Effect Snow](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010%3C0061:WWFTTE%3E2.0.CO;2). Figure 1 is a time series graph of the air and lake temperatures throughout the year at Buffalo, New York. There may be a few differences between the figure in the journal article and mine, but they are essentially the same. For example, the temperatures are slightly different because the data I used included an additional 20+ years worth of data. These datasets are both from the National Weather Service of Buffalo, click the following links to proceed to the data: [air](https://www.weather.gov/buf/BUFtemp) and [water](https://www.weather.gov/buf/Hist_LakeTemps). Overall this figure shows the relationship between the temperatures and lake-induced precipitation. Lake-induced precipitation occurs when the lake (or water) temperature is warmer than the air (i.e., an unstable atmosphere). Lake-induced precipitation does not occur when the lake (or water) temperature is cooler than the air (i.e., a stable atmosphere).

## Relation To My Research Topic
This figure is certainly related to my research topic for METR 3334. My research topic is about improving lake effect snow forecasts, particuarly what can we as meteorologists do to enhance our ability to forecast lake effect snow. A fundamental tool in forecasting lake effect snow is understanding the difference in temperature between the air and water. This allows for operational meteorologists to asses the stability of the atmosphere, such that they can determine if the environment is conducive for convection, and if so how deep the convection is (i.e., equilibrium or inversion height). The depth of this convection is related to the intensity of the lake effect snow bands, which is incredibly important in a forecasting context. Therefore, based on the figures, one can conclude it is imperative for meteorologists to pay close attention during December and January. These are the two months where the temperature differences are the greatest, which foster deep convection and heavy lake effect snow.
