# METR-3334-HW3-Extra-Credit
## Description
This project is related to a homework assignment in METR 3334: Principles of Research and Communications in Meteorology. The assignment required us to reproduce a figure in a published journal article relevant to our research topic. I chose to reproduce a figure (see below) from an article that discussed forecasting lake effect snow, [Winter Weather Forecasting Throughout the Eastern United States. Part IV: Lake Effect Snow](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010%3C0061:WWFTTE%3E2.0.CO;2). Figure 1 is a time series graph of the air and lake temperatures throughout the year at Buffalo, New York. There may be a few differences between the figure in the journal article and mine, but they are essentially the same. For example, the temperatures are slightly different because the data I used included an additional 20+ years worth of data. These datasets are both from the National Weather Service of Buffalo, click the following links to proceed to the data: [air](https://www.weather.gov/buf/BUFtemp) and [water](https://www.weather.gov/buf/Hist_LakeTemps). Overall this figure shows the relationship between the temperatures and lake-induced precipitation. Lake-induced precipitation occurs when the lake (or water) temperature is warmer than the air (i.e., an unstable atmosphere). Lake-induced precipitation does not occur when the lake (or water) temperature is cooler than the air (i.e., a stable atmosphere).
